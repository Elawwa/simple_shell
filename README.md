The ALX team collaborated on a Shell project called hsh using C language, shell, and Betty linter. Essentially, hsh is a basic interpreter for the UNIX command language. It can read commands from standard input or a file and then execute them. Once a user inputs a command, hsh will display a prompt and wait for the command to be processed. It creates a child process to verify the command that accepts arguments and then returns to the parent process to print the prompt and prepare for the next command. hsh also checks for built-ins, aliases in the path, and local executable programs. Additionally, it has the capability to function in non-interactive modes.
